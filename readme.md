# wled2graph

wled2graph is a Python program designed to visualize Frames Per Second (FPS) data and other from WLED endpoints on a network in real-time using a Bokeh graph server. It sets up a polling loop, defaulting to every 5 seconds, to fetch the current JSON state from each specified WLED endpoint

Note that the Bokeh server is hosted on port 5006 by default. You can access the graph by navigating to http://localhost:5006 in your web browser.

The browser window should be spawned on wled2graph launch, however, wled2graph is not closed on closure of the browser.

You can navigate again to the same URL to re-open the graph, as long as the application is left running.

## Features

- **Real-time FPS, BSSID, RSSI and Ping Visualization**: Continuously polls WLED endpoints and updates the graph with current FPS values.
- **IP address hyperlink to WLED UI**: Just click through direct to the WLED UI for the selected WLED endpoint.
- **Configurable Polling Frequency**: Allows customization of the polling interval to suit network and performance needs.
- **Scalable**: Can monitor multiple WLED endpoints simultaneously.
- **Customizable Data Points Rollover**: Supports setting a maximum number of data points to display on the graph, after which old data points are rolled off.


## Installation from PyPi

```bash
pip install wled2graph
```

wled2graph is executed from the command line and requires a list of IP addresses corresponding to the WLED endpoints you wish to monitor.

```bash
wled2graph -w <WLED_IPs> [-t <time_period>] [-r <rollover>]
```

-w, --wleds: A comma-separated list of IP addresses for the WLED endpoints.  
-t, --time-period: (Optional) The time period in seconds for polling the WLEDs. Default is 5 seconds.  
-r, --rollover: (Optional) The number of data points to keep in the graph before rolling over. Default is 20000.  
-m, --remote: allow remote access to server on port 5006, default is False  

### Example
To start monitoring two WLED endpoints with a polling interval of 10 seconds:

```bash
wled2graph -w 192.168.1.100,192.168.1.101 -t 10
```

To start monitoring five WLED endpoints with a polling interval of 1 seconds and a data point rollover of 30:

```bash
wled2graph -w "192.168.1.216, 192.168.1.217, 192.168.1.220, 192.168.1.229, 192.168.1.230" -t 1 -r 30
```

# How to develop on wled2graph

Source code is hosted at https://github.com/bigredfrog/wled2graph

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.9 or higher
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation), a tool for dependency management in Python projects.

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/bigredfrog/wled2graph.git
    cd wled2graph
    ```

2. Install the project dependencies using Poetry:

    ```bash
    poetry install
    ```

    This will create a virtual environment and install the necessary Python libraries.

## Development Usage

wled2graph is executed from the command line and requires a list of IP addresses corresponding to the WLED endpoints you wish to monitor.

```bash
poetry run python main.py -w <WLED_IPs> [-t <time_period>] [-r <rollover>]
```

-w, --wleds: A comma-separated list of IP addresses for the WLED endpoints.  
-t, --time-period: (Optional) The time period in seconds for polling the WLEDs. Default is 5 seconds.  
-r, --rollover: (Optional) The number of data points to keep in the graph before rolling over. Default is 20000.  

### Example
To start monitoring two WLED endpoints with a polling interval of 10 seconds:

```bash
poetry run python main.py -w 192.168.1.100,192.168.1.101 -t 10
```

To start monitoring five WLED endpoints with a polling interval of 1 seconds and a data point rollover of 30:

```bash
poetry run python main.py -w "192.168.1.216, 192.168.1.217, 192.168.1.220, 192.168.1.229, 192.168.1.230" -t 1 -r 30
```

## VSCode support

wled2graph incluses a .vscode/launch.json

### Verify the virtual environment python interpreter path

After running poetry install, verify the path to the virtual environment via

```bash
poetry env info --path
```

### Set the Python Interpreter for the project in VSCode

Press Ctrl + Shift + P (or Cmd + Shift + P on macOS) and select "Python: Select Interpreter".
Browse to the virtual environment path from the previous step and select the python executable inside it.

### Edit the "args" options in launch.json

add your IP address of interest or other launch options

### Launch from the debugpy Run and Debug drop down

wled2graph should run in the virtual environment against your selected args
